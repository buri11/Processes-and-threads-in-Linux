# Processes-and-threads-in-Linux
This project is about creating processes and threads and synchronizing them.

This was yet another project at the Operating Systems subject at my university. 

All of the requirements for this project are described in the "a2.pdf" file. My contribution is only in the "a2.c" file, all the others files being created by my teacher for evaluation or helping porposes.

The project is designed to work on a Linux machine.
